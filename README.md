Adds support for the P1 Reader "[SlimmeLezer+](https://www.zuidwijk.com/product/slimmelezer-plus/)" to Homey Pro

## SlimmeLezer+
SlimmeLezer integrates your energy meter with P1 port seamlessly into Home Assistant. Plug and play, no coding necessary. It comes pre-installed with ESPHome code. After joining it to your WiFi it will be recognized in Home Assistant and can be added easily.

The SlimmeLezer is designed to work with DSMR/ESMR 5. Working with DSMR 5 means that the Smart Meter can deliver enough power through the P1 port to power the reader. Therefore no extra power adapter is needed to work.

The device is based on the ESPHome OS
